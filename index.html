      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>I recently moved back to Utah from California after having my son last year. He just turned 1 year old this January.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Everywhere! I was born in California. Elementary in Las Vegas. Highschool in Southern Utah. College in Salt Lake City.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Does spending time with my kid and wife count? Computer gaming is a second. Learning is a third.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>To create. To Learn. I have a lot of ideas/projects in mind. I've been creating since I was a kid. I created my first HTML webpage, self taught at the age of 15 in the days of Netscape, AOL and dial up.</p>
